# JoinUS
A simple web app made to register emails to a database using Node JS, CSS and HTML connecting to MySQL.

# How to use?
- First, you must have MySQL installed on your machine (localy or throw Docker);
- Clone the repository;
- Create the join_us database using the query I provided on the file "DatabaseAndQueries.sql"
- Open up Bash or PowerShell on the JoinUs folder and run the application with `node app.js` to start the localhost;
- Access the localhost through your web browser: `localhost:8080`;
- Have fun :D
