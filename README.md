# JoinUS
A simple web app made to register emails to a database using Node JS, CSS and HTML connecting to MySQL.

# How to use?

- Create the join_us database using the query I provided on the file "DatabaseAndQueries.sql"
- Open your shell terminal where the app.js is located and run `node app.js`;
- Access the localhost through your web browser: `localhost:8080`;
- Have fun :D
